_Too many variables? Should you be using all possible variables to generate model?_

In order to handle __'curse of dimensionality'__ and avoid issues like __over-fitting__ in high dimensional space, methods like __Principal Component analysis__ is used.

PCA is a method used for __compressing__ a lot of data into something that captures the __essence__ of the _original data_.
- It reduces the dimension of your data with the __aim of retaining__ as _much information as possible_. 
- Calculated efficiently with computer programs
- This method combines __highly correlated variables__ together to form a smaller number of an artificial set of variables.<br/>   
- These artificial set of variables are called __'principal components'__ that account for __most variance__ in the data.
